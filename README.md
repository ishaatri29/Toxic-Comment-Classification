# Toxic-Comment-Classification
The prevalence of online toxicity has become a growing concern in social media platforms, and it can negativelyimpact individuals and communities. In this model, we will work a toxic comment classification dataset that includes comments labeled with multiple toxicclasses, and use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to build a multilabel predictive model.
The dataset used in this assignment contains a large number of comments from various online platforms, such as Wikipedia, Reddit, and Twitter. Each comment is labeled with multiple classes of toxicity, including severe toxicity, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate, and others. A comment may belong to one or more toxicity classes, making this a multilabel classification task.
The main goal of this assignment is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify toxic comments into one or more toxicity classes in the dataset, using some innovative methods. To achieve this goal, you need to follow the following steps:

1.	Data Exploration and Preparation:
•	 The dataset is explores and analyzed by the distribution of each toxicity class,the text data is then preprocessed by removing stopwords, punctuation and other irrelevant characters. Also, text normalization techniques is performed
such as stemming and lemmatization and then the data is split into training and testing sets.

2.	Feature Extraction:
•	  The relevant features is extracted from the preprocessed text data, such as Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings.

3.	Model Building:
•	  Models are build, using Multi-label Classification Techniques, the performance of each model is evaluated.

4.	Comparing Models and concluding:
•	Compare the best model and predict their toxicity classes,and a flaskapi is build.
